# DiamondCore

This is a server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edition and Minecraft
written in java, it's soul purpouse is to allow both sides to play
together without using mods, kind of like BigBrother in PocketMine.

# Why did you wipe recently?

I wiped it because now that I knew what I was doing, it would be a
good idea to start over, as some stuff was looking unsorted and NEEDED
to be changed, but there seemed to be too much to keep up with.

# Do you like French Fries?

Yes.
